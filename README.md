# LMB Tracker

## Installation

Use the provided `setup.py` file to install the `lmb` package in the currently activated environment. This enables its usage in the example scripts or your own modules.

````
python setup.py install
````

Using the `develop` option instead of `install` creates a symbolic link towards the package and thus enables continuous development without having to reinstall the package after changes.
